Understanding the Report Mobile Layout in Power BI
Power BI offers a Mobile Layout feature to optimize reports for viewing and interacting on mobile devices. This layout is designed to provide a user-friendly, responsive experience by tailoring visuals to smaller screens, such as smartphones.
Key Features of Report Mobile Layout
Separate Mobile Layout:

The mobile layout is a distinct design from the desktop layout.
You can rearrange and resize visuals specifically for mobile users without altering the desktop report.
Portrait Orientation:

The mobile layout is designed in portrait orientation, which fits most smartphone screens better than the standard landscape (desktop) layout.
Customizable Visual Arrangement:

You can include or exclude specific visuals from the mobile view, focusing only on the most important data for quick insights.
Interactivity:

Mobile reports maintain interactivity, including slicers, filters, drill-throughs, and tooltips.
Lightweight and Focused:

Mobile layouts encourage simplicity, displaying only the most essential KPIs or visuals for quick decision-making.

Best Practices for Mobile Layout Design
Focus on Key Metrics:

Display critical KPIs and summary visuals at the top for quick access.
Avoid complex visuals like scatter plots or large tables, as they may be hard to interpret on small screens.
Optimize for Readability:

Use larger fonts and ensure sufficient spacing between visuals to avoid crowding.
Prefer simple charts like bar or line charts over detailed visuals.
Use Slicers and Filters Wisely:

Include slicers or dropdown filters for quick data filtering, but donâ€™t overload the mobile layout with too many interactive elements.
Test Responsiveness:

Use the Power BI Mobile App to test your layout and ensure it looks good on actual devices.
