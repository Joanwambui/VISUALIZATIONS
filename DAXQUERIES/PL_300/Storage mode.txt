Storage mode
Lets you control whether or not power bi caches table data in-memory for reports. Caching means temporarily storing data in memory.

You can set the storage mode for each model individually in your model, enabling a single semantic model providing these benefits:
Query performance - as users interact with visuals in BI, DAX queries are submitted to semantic model. caching data into memory by properly setting storage mode can boost query performance and intrctvty of reports.
Large semantic models: tables that are not cached don't consume memory for caching purposes. You can enable intrctve analysis over larger semantic models that are too large or too expensive to compltly cache in memory.
Data refresh optmztn: don't need to refresh tables that aren't cached. reduce refresh time by caching only the data that's necessary to meet your service level agreements and biz rqrmnts.
Near real time mngmnt: Tables wit near real time managmnt might benefit from not being cached
Writeback-enables biz users to explore whatif scenarios by changing cell values

Storage mode can be one of the three rltd features
Composite modes-have two or more data connections
Many-to-many rltnships-rqqrmnts are removed for unique values in tables.
storage mode-specify which visuals require a query to backend data sources

IMPORT
With this tables are cached. Queries submitted to BI Semantic model that return data from Import tables can be fulfilled from cached data.

Examples:
SaleAggregate table
Historical sales data
Product Catalog
Customer demographics
Financial Reports
Employee Directory
Marketing Campaign
Annual budget data
Standardized scores
Inventory levels


DIRECTQUERY
Tables with this setting aren't cached.EG DAX Queries return data from directquery tables can only be fulfilled only by executing on-demand queries to data source. 

Real Time inventory tracking
Live Financial Data
Current order status
Website traffic analytics
Social Media Feeds
Sensor Data
Stock levels
Weather Data
Transport and Logistics

DUAL
This setting can either be cached or not caced depending on context of the quer thats submitted to BI Semantic model. In some fulfill from cached data and other cases fulfill by on-demand query to data source

Product availability
Employee work hours
Customer Orders
Stock Market analysis
Warehouse Inventory
Stock market analysis
Sales Pipline
