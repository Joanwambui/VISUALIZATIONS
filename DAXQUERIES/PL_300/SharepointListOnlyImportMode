When populating a table in a Power BI dataset with data from a Microsoft SharePoint Online list, the default storage mode is Imported.

Explanation:
Imported Mode:
Data is loaded into the Power BI model and stored in-memory. This is the typical mode for SharePoint Online lists, ensuring fast performance as queries run against the local in-memory model instead of hitting the SharePoint server.
Why not the others?
DirectQuery:

Power BI does not currently support DirectQuery for SharePoint Online lists. Data must first be imported into the Power BI model.
Live Connection:

Live connection is specific to certain sources like Analysis Services or Power BI datasets. SharePoint Online lists do not use this mode.
Composite Mode:

Composite mode combines Imported and DirectQuery for specific tables within a model, but since DirectQuery isn't supported for SharePoint Online lists, composite mode doesn't apply here
