The Analyze feature allows a user to understand why the distribution of data looks the way it does.

Time series charts can be imported from AppSource.

The AI Splits feature in Power BI is a functionality within the Decomposition Tree visual.
It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically identify and suggest factors that contribute the most to a given value or trend in your data.

AI splits work by considering all the available fields and determining which one to drill into to get the highest/lowest value of a measure that is being analyzed.

you can access the Q&A feature by selecting the Q&A button type.

Decomposition tree can enable one to:
Conduct root cause analysis to understand a measure better.
Automatically analyze selected dimensions to find where a measure is highest or lowest.

If edit interactions is not set when you select a value in the line chart it will cross filter the other visuals otherwise nothing will happen

You plan to create the chart shown in the following exhibit.
How should you create the dashed horizontal line denoting the 40th percentile of daily sales for the period shown?
Add a new percentile line that uses Total Sales as the measure and 40% as the percentile.

R plots are limited to 150,000 rows

You use Power BI Desktop to create a visualization for a Microsoft SQL Server data source.
You need to ensure that you can use R visualization.
Which two actions should you perform?
Enable R Scripting on the computer that has Power BI Desktop installed, Download and install Microsoft R on the computer that has Power BI Desktop installed.

How does the admin workspace role differ from other types of workspace roles?
Admins are the only role that can remove users.

What feature in Power BI service can you use to troubleshoot the flow of data from its source to destination?
Lineage view

You have multiple dashboards.
You need to ensure that when users browse the available dashboards from powerbi.com, they can see which dashboards contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The solution must minimize configuration effort and impact on the dashboard design.
What should you use?
Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels

In the Power BI service, sensitivity labels can be applied to semantic models, reports, dashboards, and dataflows.
When labeled data leaves Power BI, either via export to Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, or .pbix files, or via other supported export scenarios such as Analyze in Excel or live connection PivotTables in Excel, Power BI automatically applies the label to the exported file and protects it according to the label's file encryption settings.
This way your sensitive data can remain protected, even when it leaves Power BI.

Your company plans to completely separate development and production assets such as datasets, reports, and dashboards in Microsoft Power BI.
You need to recommend an application lifecycle strategy.
The solution must minimize access to production assets and prevent end users from viewing the development assets. What should you recommend?
Create a workspace for development and a workspace for production. From the production workspace, publish an app.

Uses data stoed in microsoft one drive for business and uses custom visuals - These two can be embedded in a website
RLS, Report shared to user account, uses on prem SSAS DB these reports can't be embedded in a website.

To manage those that have access to apps - From the Office 365 Admin center, click Groups.

Your organization has a Microsoft Office 365 subscription.
When the users attempt to access the Power BI Service, they receive the error message shown in the exhibit.
(Your IT has turned off signup options)
From Microsoft Azure PowerShell, run the Set-MsolCompanySettings cmdlet.
The Set-MsolCompanySettings cmdlet is used to set company-level configuration settings.

Access a published power BI APP - You need a fee license fo this. Modify reports in an app wokspace you need a PRO license for this. Share dashboards create in my worspace need a PRO licese.

Power BI Premium is cheaper to procure compared to Power BI Pro - if you have like 1000 users and all to use the reports

You plan to deploy a Power BI app workspace that will be viewed by 10,000 users.
You need to ensure that dashboard data can be updated every 30 minutes.
What should you do?
Configure the app workspace for Premium capacity.

Free users can't access other app workspaces but only if the workspace is backed up by a premium license.
Admin roles are the only ones that can add others as members

Power BI Admin portal
Scale up customers capacity by accessing it from pricing tier from Azure Portal

From the app workspace settings, add a member.
All the members of a workspace can automatically see the APP related to this workspace.
So, we should add USER1 as a member is this workspace

Member can delete reports but Contributor cannot delete (They can only Create and edit but not delete)

Your company has a custom line-of-business application named SalesApp.
The developers of SalesApp want to push data into the Power BI service to create several visualizations.
You need to ensure that the developers can push the data from SalesApp to the Power BI service.
What should you do?
Go to dev.powerbi.com/apps and register an application.

What reserved parameters configure the start and end of where incremental refresh should occur?
RangeStart and RangeEnd

Promotion does not need specific permissions while Certification requires permission from the dataset owner to access the dataset.

Promotion: No special permissions required; it's a label to highlight important content.
Certification: Requires dataset ownerâ€™s permission; it guarantees trust and accuracy.

You are building a dataset from a JSON file that contains an array of documents.
You need to import attributes as columns from all the documents in the JSON file.
The solution must ensure that date attributes can be used as date hierarchies in Microsoft Power BI reports.
convert list to a table,expand the columns, set the data types

You have a Power BI tenant.
You have reports that use financial datasets and are exported as PDF files.
You need to ensure that the reports are encrypted.
What should you implement?
sensitivity labels

You create a report by using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
The report uses data from a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube located on your company's internal network.
You plan to publish the report to the Power BI Service.

What should you implement to ensure that users who consume the report from the Power BI Service have the most up-to-date data from the cube?
an On-premises data gateway

Static Role:
Purpose: Controls data access for different users based on predefined rules.
Functionality:
Created using Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI.
Filters data dynamically based on the user's role or identity (e.g., a "Sales Manager" role might only see sales data for their region).
Applies to all reports using the dataset, ensuring secure data sharing.
Example: A role that ensures "Kenya Sales Rep" only sees sales data from Kenya.

Bookmark:
Purpose: Saves and restores a specific report view for all users.
Functionality:
Created in the Power BI report view.
Captures visual settings like applied filters, slicers, sorting, and visual configurations.
Does not affect the underlying data security; anyone with access to the report can use the bookmark.

Is it possible for a user to be a part of two RLS roles?
Yes, the roles will be combined for the user
If a user is part of two roles, the RLS roles are combined for the individual.

benefit of incremental refresh?
Faster refresh times
More reliable
Reduced resource usage

Incremental refresh in Power BI needs query folding because query folding ensures that the filtering, transformations, and partitioning logic can be pushed back to the data source for efficient processing.
Without query folding, the entire dataset must be loaded into memory, which defeats the purpose of incremental refresh and can cause performance issues.

Query folding is the ability for Power Query to generate a single query statement to retrieve and transform source data to improve the efficiency of the Power Query engines.
Unfortunately, flat files do not support query folding.

1. Download ad install an on-premises data gateway (Personal Mode), as this is the only gateway you can choose based on the task given option
2. Configure the Gateway Connections settings for the dataset
3. Configure the Schedule Refresh settings for the dataset

You modify the dataset to allow featured questions to show as suggested Q&As.
