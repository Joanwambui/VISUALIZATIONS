### Relationship Purpose in Power BI Models
singles its slow and assigns or refers to one table on the right. 

#### General Propagation
- Filters applied to one table can propagate to related tables through defined relationships.
- Relationships are deterministic, ensuring consistent filter propagation.
- DAX functions can modify or disable filter propagation.
- Model relationships do not enforce data integrity.

#### Example of Filter Propagation
- Model with tables: Category, Product, Year, Sales.
- Category filters Product, Product filters Sales, and Year filters Sales.
- Combined filters (Category and Year) result in an AND operation on the Sales table.

#### Star Schema Design
- Use star schema design principles with dimension and fact tables.
- Dimension tables filter fact tables efficiently.
- Example: Adventure Works model with a single fact table (Sales) and four dimension tables.

#### Disconnected Tables
- Unrelated tables in a model, called disconnected tables, do not propagate filters.
- Used for user input, e.g., currency exchange rates for sales conversion.

#### Relationship Properties
- Relate columns between different tables, typically one-to-many or many-to-one.
- Data types of related columns must match.
- Power BI detects and sets cardinality type but allows manual updates.

#### Cardinality Types
- One-to-many (1:*), many-to-one (*:1), one-to-one (1:1), many-to-many (*:*).
- One-to-many and many-to-one are the most common.
- Many-to-many for complex model requirements.

#### Cross Filter Direction
- Single (default) or both (bi-directional) directions.
- Bi-directional filtering can impact performance and cause ambiguity.

#### Active vs Inactive Relationships
- Only one active filter path between tables.
- Inactive relationships used in specific calculations with USERELATIONSHIP DAX function.
- Active relationships are preferred.

#### Referential Integrity
- Assume referential integrity property for DirectQuery tables, improving performance.
- Should be enabled when data integrity is ensured.

#### Relevant DAX Functions
- RELATED, RELATEDTABLE, USERELATIONSHIP, CROSSFILTER, COMBINEVALUES, TREATAS, Parent and Child functions.

#### Relationship Evaluation
- Regular relationships: one-to-many within the same source group.
- Limited relationships: many-to-many or cross-source group, no guaranteed "one" side.
- Table expansion for regular relationships using JOIN semantics.

#### Resolving Path Ambiguity
- Power BI resolves filter path ambiguity using priority and weight rules.
- Use USERELATIONSHIP function to influence relationship weights and resolve ambiguities.

#### Performance Preferences
- Fastest to slowest filter propagation:
  - One-to-many intra source group relationships.
  - Many-to-many with intermediary table and bi-directional relationship.
  - Many-to-many cardinality relationships.
  - Cross source group relationships.
