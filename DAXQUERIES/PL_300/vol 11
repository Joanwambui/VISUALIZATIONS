Node.js
To develop custom visuals, you need to have NodeJS installed with Power BI tools and a server certificate.

custom visuals must be imported from AppSource each time you start developing a new report.

One can analyze the performance of each of the report elements by using the performance analyzer 

Can you use bookmarks to create a slide show in Power BI?
Yes, you can, by adding buttons as navigation to go between saved bookmarks.

custom streaming data
The only way to visualize a streaming dataset is to add a tile and use the streaming dataset as a custom streaming data source.

You create a dashboard by using the Microsoft Power BI Service. The dashboard contains a card visual that shows total sales from the current year.
You grant users access to the dashboard by using the Viewer role on the workspace.
A user wants to receive daily notifications of the number shown on the card visual.
You need to automate the notifications.
What should you do?
Create a subscription.
You can subscribe yourself and your colleagues to the report pages, dashboards, and paginated reports that matter most to you. Power BI e-mail subscriptions allow you to:
- Decide how often you want to receive the emails: daily, weekly, hourly, monthly, or once a day after the initial data refresh.
- Choose the time you want to receive the email, if you choose daily, weekly, hourly, or monthly.
Note: Email subscriptions don't support most custom visuals. The one exception is those custom visuals that have been certified.
Email subscriptions don't support R-powered custom visuals at this time.

The key influencers visual helps you understand the factors that drive a metric you're interested in. It analyzes your data, ranks the factors that matter, and displays them as key influencers.
The key influencers visual is a great choice if you want to:
- See which factors affect the metric being analyzed.
- Contrast the relative importance of these factors. For example, do short-term contracts have more impact on churn than long-term contracts?

You have a dataset named Pens that contains the following columns:
- Unit Price
- Quantity Ordered
You need to create a visualization that shows the relationship between Unit Price and Quantity Ordered. The solution must highlight orders that have a similar unit price and ordered quantity.
Which type of visualization and which feature should you use?
A scatter plot.
A scatter chart always has two value axes to show: one set of numerical data along a horizontal axis and another set of numerical values along a vertical axis.
The chart displays points at the intersection of an x and y numerical value, combining these values into single data points.
Power BI may distribute these data points evenly or unevenly across the horizontal axis. It depends on the data the chart represents.
Automatically find clusters
Scatter charts are a great choice to show patterns in large sets of data, for example by showing linear or non-linear trends, clusters, and outliers.

Scatter Charts
Purpose: Displays data points based on two numerical variables plotted on the X and Y axes.
Use Cases:
Analyze relationships between two variables.
Spot patterns, clusters, and outliers in data.
Substitute for line charts to reveal scale changes.
Features:
Maximum of 10,000 data points.
Tooltip support for detailed information on data points.
Adjustable axis scales (including logarithmic).

Outliers are those data points that lie outside the overall pattern of distribution & the easiest way to detect outliers is though graphs.
  Box plots, Scatter plots can help detect them easily.

The best data for forecasting is time series data or uniformly increasing whole numbers is Line Chart. The line chart has to have only one line.
Try forecasting: Try the new forecasting capabilities of Power View today on your own data or with the sample report available as part of the Power BI report samples. 
To view your own data, upload a workbook with a Power View time series line chart to Power BI for Office 365.

Common use cases for scatter charts include showing patterns in large sets of data, showing linear & non-linear trends, 
performing cluser analysis, and identifying outliers.

The Q&A visual lets you explore data "in your own words" using what?
Natural language queries

Visual level filters apply only to the specific visual in which they are defined.

The decomposition tree visual allows you to perform exploratory analysis by successively breaking down a measure across multiple dimensions.
The key influencers visual helps you understand the factors that drive a specific metric.
