In Power BI, the types of joins (or merges) used when combining data from different tables are as follows:

Inner Join
Left Outer Join
Right Outer Join
Full Outer Join
Anti Join (Left Anti and Right Anti)
Cross Join
Here are 6 examples of scenarios for each type of join:

1. Inner Join
Definition: An inner join returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

Examples:

Sales and Customers: Combining tables of sales transactions and customer details to get a list of sales transactions where customer information is available.
Employees and Departments: Merging tables to show only employees who are currently assigned to a department.
Orders and Products: Joining orders with products to analyze only the orders that contain products listed in the catalog.
Students and Enrollments: Combining students with their course enrollments to see which students are enrolled in which courses.
Projects and Assignments: Merging tables to show only projects that have assignments logged.
Invoices and Payments: Combining invoices with payments to see which invoices have been paid.
2. Left Outer Join
Definition: A left outer join returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the right table result in NULLs.

Examples:

Products and Sales: Listing all products and showing their sales if available, otherwise showing NULL for sales.
Employees and Managers: Displaying all employees and their managers, if they have been assigned one.
Orders and Shipments: Showing all orders and their shipment details, if they have been shipped.
Books and Authors: Listing all books and their authors, if authorship information is available.
Customers and Feedback: Displaying all customers and their feedback if they have provided any.
Projects and Budgets: Showing all projects with their budget information, if budgets have been assigned.
3. Right Outer Join
Definition: A right outer join returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. Unmatched rows from the left table result in NULLs.

Examples:

Departments and Employees: Listing all departments and showing the employees in each, including departments with no employees.
Events and Attendees: Showing all events and the attendees, including events with no attendees.
Products and Inventory: Displaying all inventory items and the products they correspond to, including inventory items not yet linked to a product.
Courses and Instructors: Listing all courses and their instructors, including courses without assigned instructors.
Stores and Sales Data: Showing all stores and their sales data, including stores without sales.
Vendors and Orders: Displaying all vendors and their orders, including vendors who haven't received any orders.
4. Full Outer Join
Definition: A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Rows that do not have matches in the other table will contain NULL.

Examples:

Customers and Orders: Listing all customers and their orders, including customers with no orders and orders with no customer information.
Products and Reviews: Displaying all products and reviews, including products without reviews and reviews for products not in the catalog.
Employees and Projects: Showing all employees and projects, including employees not assigned to any projects and projects without assigned employees.
Accounts and Transactions: Listing all accounts and their transactions, including accounts without transactions and transactions without linked accounts.
Books and Borrowers: Showing all books and borrowers, including books not borrowed and borrowers with no books.
Suppliers and Shipments: Displaying all suppliers and shipments, including suppliers without shipments and shipments with no supplier information.
5. Anti Join (Left Anti and Right Anti)
Definition: An anti join returns the rows from one table that do not have a match in the other table.

Left Anti Join: Returns rows from the left table that do not have matches in the right table.
Right Anti Join: Returns rows from the right table that do not have matches in the left table.

Examples:

Left Anti Join:

Employees not Assigned to Projects: Listing employees who are not assigned to any projects.
Products without Sales: Displaying products that have not been sold.
Students not Enrolled in Courses: Showing students who are not enrolled in any courses.
Books not Borrowed: Listing books that have not been borrowed.
Orders without Payments: Displaying orders that have not been paid.
Customers without Feedback: Listing customers who have not provided feedback.
Right Anti Join:

Projects without Employees: Showing projects that have no assigned employees.
Sales without Products: Listing sales transactions with products that are not in the catalog.
Courses without Students: Displaying courses that have no enrolled students.
Borrowers without Books: Listing borrowers who have not borrowed any books.
Payments without Orders: Displaying payments that are not linked to any orders.
Feedback without Customers: Listing feedback entries that are not associated with any customers.
6. Cross Join
Definition: A cross join returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows from both tables.

Examples:

Customers and Products: Generating all possible combinations of customers and products for potential recommendation scenarios.
Employees and Projects: Creating all possible combinations of employees and projects for assignment planning.
Stores and Promotions: Listing all possible combinations of stores and promotions to analyze the potential impact.
Students and Activities: Creating combinations of students and extracurricular activities for activity assignment.
Salespeople and Territories: Generating all possible combinations of salespeople and territories for coverage analysis.
Courses and Semesters: Listing all possible combinations of courses and semesters to prepare the academic schedule.
Each join type serves different analytical purposes, allowing for a variety of data integration scenarios in Power BI.
