RLS
 In the Power BI service, users with access to a workspace have access to semantic models in that workspace. RLS only restricts data access for users with Viewer permissions. It doesn't apply to Admins, Members, or Contributors.
If you want report layout to not be changed, most definitely use app to share reports or rather manage access

RLS does not apply to Admins, Members, or Contributors, only to users with Viewer permissions.
Using an app ensures the report layout remains unchange

1. Admin
Admins have the highest level of permissions in a Power BI workspace. They can:

Add and remove members, admins, contributors, and viewers.
Delete the workspace.
Update workspace settings.
Publish, edit, and delete content (reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, etc.).
Share content with others.
Schedule data refreshes.
Take over ownership of datasets.
2. Member
Members have significant permissions but less than admins. They can:

Add and remove members, contributors, and viewers (but not admins).
Publish, edit, and delete content (reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, etc.).
Share content with others.
Schedule data refreshes.
3. Contributor
Contributors have permissions to work with the content but cannot manage membership. They can:

Publish, edit, and delete content (reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, etc.).
Schedule data refreshes.
Share content with others (if given explicit permission to do so).
4. Viewer
Viewers have the most limited permissions, primarily focused on consumption rather than creation or management. They can:

View and interact with reports and dashboards shared with them.
Export data (if the export setting is enabled on the dataset).
Cannot edit or publish content.
Cannot manage workspace settings or memberships.
5. Reshare Permissions
Additionally, the ability to reshare content is a specific permission that can be granted to members, contributors, and viewers. This permission allows users to share the content they have access to with others.
