Parameters

By using parameters, you can easily switch the data source between different environments without modifying the report or managing multiple PBIX files, thereby minimizing administrative effort.

We only need One Parameter to transverse amongst the three databases.

To meet the requirements specified, we can use a single parameter in the PBIX file that controls which database is used for data consumption based on the stage of the development lifecycle.

We can use a Text parameter type in Power BI to achieve this. The parameter can be used to switch between the different database connections when a user interacts with the report. The text parameter could include values such as "Development", "Staging", and "Production", which correspond to the different databases shown in the table.

The parameter can then be used in the queries to dynamically filter the data based on the selected stage of the development lifecycle. By using a single parameter, we can minimize administrative effort and ensure that the report works with each stage of the development lifecycle.



Power Query sequential steps:
Selct discount column
select replace errors to replace error value with 0.05
Discount value change data type to decimal no


Error could not find file in powerquery means:
referenced file moved to new location, don't have permssns to the file
