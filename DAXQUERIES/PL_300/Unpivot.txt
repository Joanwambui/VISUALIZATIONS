Unpivot
You might want to unpivot data, sometimes called flattening the data, to put it in a matrix format so that all similar values are in one column. This is necessary, for example, to create a chart or a report.



Transaction ID	Product A	Product B	Product C
1	10	5	3
2	8	2	6
3	6	4	7



To unpivot this data, we can transform it into a long format where each row represents a single product sold in a transaction, like this:

Transaction ID	Product	Quantity
1	Product A	10
1	Product B	5
1	Product C	3
2	Product A	8
2	Product B	2
2	Product C	6
3	Product A	6
3	Product B	4
3	Product C	7
