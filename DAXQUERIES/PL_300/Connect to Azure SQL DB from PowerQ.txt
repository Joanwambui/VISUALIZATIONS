Connect using advanced options
Both Power Query Desktop and Power Query Online provide a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.
Advanced option	Description
Command timeout in minutes	If your connection lasts longer than 10 minutes (the default timeout), you can enter another value in minutes to keep the connection open longer. This option is only available in Power Query Desktop.
SQL statement	For information, go to Import data from a database using native database query.
Include relationship columns	If checked, includes columns that might have relationships to other tables. If this box is cleared, you wonâ€™t see those columns.
Navigate using full hierarchy	If checked, the navigator displays the complete hierarchy of tables in the database you're connecting to. If cleared, the navigator displays only the tables whose columns and rows contain data.
Enable SQL Server Failover support	If checked, when a node in the Azure SQL failover group isn't available, Power Query moves from that node to another when failover occurs. If cleared, no failover occurs.

The navigator will display only tables with data
