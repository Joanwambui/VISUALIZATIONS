workspace organization:
-common dataflows
-datasets
-reports
DATA WORKSPACE
REPRT WORKSPACE

Pple that can edit workspaces
contrbtr,member,admin

build allows one to create new content based on the shared datasets
a dataset already in the workspace one can use directquery for powerbi dataset to create reports

build permission allows user to:
create new reports
create composite model
connect xmla endpoint
analyze in excel

bbuild permission can be granted directly via dataet permission or indirectly granted in the following ways
-saring report/dasboard
-publishing an app
workspace roles of contrbtr,member or admin

BI Contentt ownership approaches
-business led selfservice BI
-Managed selfservice BI
-Enterprise BI

Standard workspace allows for:
better collabooration
better security
reduced risk

my workspace - 
stadard workspace - collaboration/small team distrbtn
app - broad content distrbtn/pple you don't work closely with
sharing - 

if you have been editing the reportss and you had an app - you will have to publish on the app again
(dataset changes happen immediately (from workspace to app))
there is a workaround for this though- 

workspace you can limit access to those authoring,developing,data validators, qa ad user accptnce testing

for the app it provides access to read only consumers

distrbtn of content frm wrkspace can be done from links or direct access

if you navigate to security - you can add people in the rowevel security but if there many users that can be time-consuming so instead we can create
security group in azure active directory then write pyton script to add/remove users dynamically.
implemented this by providing azure ad creds
-tenant id, client_id, user_principal_name = email
instead of adding all the members now we can just add the security group instead.
now test as role still on service
