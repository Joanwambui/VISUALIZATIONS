Featured tables in BI to appearinexcel

how to set tables as featured in Power BI so they can be easily used in Excel. Here's a simplified summary:

Select a Table in Power BI Desktop:

Go to Model view.
Select a table and set "Is featured table" to Yes.
Fill in the required fields (Description, Row label, Key column).
Publish the Semantic Model:

Save the model with featured tables to a shared workspace.
Once published, the featured table appears in the Excel Data Types Gallery.
Using Featured Tables in Excel:

Restart Excel to see the newly published tables.
Excel will use these tables like a lookup function, matching cell values to table rows.
Considerations and Limitations:

Not all semantic models are supported (e.g., DirectQuery models).
Excel only shows data from columns, calculated columns, and measures in the featured table.
Some features and symbols are not supported.
This makes it easier for users to integrate enterprise data from Power BI into their Excel sheets.

Row label easily identifies the row, it appears as the cell value for a linked cell in data selector pane and Information card
Key column provides unique ID for the row. Enables excel to link cell to specified row in table.

We use text columns in featured table for row matching, most numerical columns are not considere for matching.
