syncing the slicers across all pages or Replacing the slicers with report-level filters have the same effect. Users will manage to filter the report once across all pages
 1. Syncing Slicers Across All Pages
What It Does: Syncing slicers allows slicers on different pages of a report to stay connected. When a user makes a selection on one slicer (e.g., filtering by "Region" on Page 1), the same filter is applied to slicers on all other pages.
How It Works:
In the Sync Slicers Pane, you can select which pages the slicer should be synced across.
You can choose whether the slicer is visible on each page or just synced in the background.
Advantages:
Gives users the flexibility of visual interaction with slicers across pages.
Ideal if you want slicers visible on multiple pages for easy modification.
Example Use Case:
If you have a "Year" slicer on multiple pages, syncing ensures selecting "2023" on Page 1 applies to all other pages with the same slicer.
2. Replacing Slicers with Report-Level Filters
What It Does: Report-level filters are set in the Filters pane and apply a filter to the entire report. Users can manage the filter once, and it automatically applies to all pages without the need for visible slicers.
How It Works:
Add fields to the Filters on all pages section in the Filters pane.
Users interact with these filters from the Filters pane, not directly on the visuals.
Advantages:
Reduces visual clutter since no slicers are required on the report.
Ensures consistent filtering across all pages with minimal setup.
Example Use Case:
If you have a "Region" filter and want all report pages to focus on "North America," using a report-level filter achieves this seamlessly.
