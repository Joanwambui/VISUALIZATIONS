Impoting data from Cosmos DB
This behavior is by design. The Preview pane in Power BI shows a list of Record items when connecting to a collection of JSON formatted items. To view individual item fields, open the Power Query window and use the Expander button on the right side of the Column1 header to display the list of fields. Switching to the model view would not benefit us in any way, since the data has not been imported yet. Retrieving Cosmos DB account key or connection string at this point is meaningless, since that was required to connect to Cosmos DB account, which has been already completed.

Having multiple columns is Pivot
Minimizing columns by summarization is Unpivot Columns

The pivot column operation converts data into a table by aggregating values in a column. In this case, you can pivot the columns to calculate the count of product subcategories in each product category. The unpivot column operation performs the opposite task, converting columns into rows. Renaming columns would result in a table with different column names but the same data content. Transposing would simply switch rows and columns, without the required aggregation.

You have a Power BI model with the following fact tables and storage modes.

FactStoreSales (Import mode)
FactOnlineSales (DirectQuery mode)
You have a dimension table named DimCalendar that has a relationship to both fact tables.
Since Dimtable has a relationship to both fact tables we will have to use Dual mode to import the datain order to be able to efficiently get data from both the impot and DirectQuery mode.

Only the Select Columns command will let you choose columns to keep, delete the columns you do not want, and prevent new columns from showing up in the table in the future.


As part of setting up row-level security, it is necessary to create a role. In addition, it is necessary to add a DAX expression filter to the Salesperson table. This expression checks for a match between the salesperson's User Principal Name attribute and the value in the UPN column. If the two match, the salesperson is allowed to view the content of the corresponding row from the Salesperson table.

You have the following Power Query M formula that generates a range of dates.

= List.Dates(#date(2020,05,31), 365, #duration(1,0,0,0))

What is the resulting date range?
a list of days starting on May 31, 2020 and ending 365 days later
The #date element designates the starting date, 365 designates the duration counter, and #duration(1,0,0,0) designates the duration interval in days, so this formula results in a listing of days starting on May 31, 2020 and ending 365 days later.

You need to prevent hidden date tables from being auto generated by Power BI Desktop for every date or datetime data type column in a dataset.

What two tasks should you perform? Each correct answer presents a complete solution
From the Current File options in Power BI Desktop, disable Auto Date/Time
Enable Mark as date table for the Calendar table.
Disabling Auto Date/Time for new files from the Current File options will disable all Auto Date/Time tables in this dataset. Enabling Mark as date table for the Calendar table will also disable the auto datetime tables in the dataset. Disabling the Global option Auto Date/Time for new files means that new files will no longer have Auto Date/Time enabled, but the file containing the current dataset will still have it enabled until it is disabled. Changing the data category will not impact the auto date table feature.
