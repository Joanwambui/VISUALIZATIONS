1. File Size Limitations
A Pro license typically imposes stricter file size limits to optimize performance for individual or small-scale users. For example:

Power BI Pro caps datasets or imports at 1 GB per file.
This restriction ensures that shared resources in the Pro environment (e.g., memory, processing power) are not overwhelmed.
A Premium license, on the other hand, is designed for enterprise-scale use cases, offering higher resource quotas. For example:

Power BI Premium supports datasets up to 10 GB (or even more with Premium per capacity).
2. Dedicated Resources in Premium
With a Pro license, resources like CPU, RAM, and storage are shared across all Pro users within the tenant. Large files can strain shared resources, reducing performance for everyone.
A Premium license, however, provides dedicated capacity. This means your operations, including handling large datasets, don't compete for resources with other users, making it possible to process larger files efficiently.
3. Performance Optimization
Processing a 3 GB file requires significant memory and computational power. These demands are better suited for the robust infrastructure Premium offers, such as high-performance data caching, larger storage pools, and enhanced refresh capabilities.
4. Enterprise Features
A Premium license also includes advanced features like Paginated Reports, AI capabilities, and XMLA endpoints, which are designed for heavy data workloads like your 3 GB XLSX file. These features complement the need for handling larger datasets.

Excel workbooks,Power BI Desktop, or .pbix report files,Comma-separated value,XML (.xml) or text (.txt), you can use Excel Get & Transform Data to query, transform, and load the data first. You can then import the Excel file into the Power BI service.
