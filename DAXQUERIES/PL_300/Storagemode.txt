The storage mode of a table in Power BI Desktop is configurable from the Model view, not the Data or Report view. Page view is an option available from within the Report view.

#
In Power BI, the workspace is divided into three main views: **Report View**, **Data View**, and **Model View**. Each view has specific capabilities and features tailored to different aspects of the report-building process. Here's a detailed breakdown of the capabilities for each view:

---

### **1. Report View**
The **Report View** is where you design and interact with the visuals that make up your report.

#### **Capabilities:**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Create and arrange visualizations (charts, tables, maps, etc.).
  - Add, edit, and format visuals (change chart types, colors, labels, etc.).
  - Use **Slicers** to filter and interact with your data dynamically.
  - Create **Bookmarks** to capture report states (e.g., filter settings).
  - Add **Text boxes**, **Shapes**, and **Images** for report annotations and design.
  - **Drillthrough**: Set up drillthrough filters so users can right-click on a data point to see more detailed information.
  - **Tooltip**: Add tooltips to visuals for enhanced interactivity (show additional info when hovering over data points).
  
- **Interactivity:**
  - **Cross-Filtering & Cross-Highlighting**: Visuals on the report interact with each other. Selecting a data point in one visual can filter or highlight data in others.
  - **Sync slicers across pages**: Create slicers that apply to multiple pages in the report.
  - **Publish to Power BI Service**: Publish the report to Power BI Service directly from the Report view.
  
- **Page View:**
  - Control the **Page Layout** of the report (size, orientation, and formatting).
  - Create and manage **multiple report pages**.
  
- **Navigation:**
  - Add **Navigation buttons** to enable users to navigate between different pages within the report.

- **Themes:**
  - Apply and customize **themes** for consistent visual design across the report.

- **Custom Visuals:**
  - Add and configure **Custom visuals** from the marketplace (e.g., maps, KPIs, etc.).

- **Filters:**
  - Add filters to visuals or the entire page/report.
  - Configure **visual-level filters**, **page-level filters**, and **report-level filters**.

### **2. Data View**
The **Data View** is where you see and work with the raw data that your visuals are based on. It lets you view tables, fields, and the data within them.

#### **Capabilities:**
- **Data Exploration:**
  - **View data tables**: Browse and inspect the data loaded into Power BI.
  - **Search for specific values** or columns in the data.
  
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Edit column names, data types, and apply simple transformations (e.g., merging or splitting columns).
  - **Create calculated columns** and **measures** using DAX.
  
- **Relationships:**
  - View and inspect **relationships** between tables.
  - Add or remove relationships between tables.
  - Manage **relationship properties** (cardinality, direction, etc.).

- **Modeling:**
  - **Storage Mode**: Change the storage mode of a table (Import, DirectQuery, or Composite).
  - **Create Hierarchies**: Create and manage hierarchies for drill-down functionality in reports.
  - **Create new tables** by applying DAX expressions (e.g., `SUMMARIZE`, `FILTER`, `GENERATE`).
  
- **Column Tools:**
  - Edit **column data types**, **formatting**, and **properties**.

- **Metadata:**
  - Edit or view **metadata** for tables and columns (such as descriptions).

---

### **3. Model View**
The **Model View** is where you define and manage the relationships and structure of your data model.

#### **Capabilities:**
- **Manage Relationships:**
  - **Create, modify, and delete relationships** between tables.
  - Adjust **relationship settings** (cardinality, cross-filter direction, active/inactive).
  
- **Model Structure:**
  - **View the schema** of your data model (tables and relationships).
  - **Create calculated tables** (tables that are dynamically created from expressions).
  
- **Storage Mode:**
  - **Change the storage mode** of tables (Import, DirectQuery, Composite).
  - Optimize performance by configuring storage settings.
  
- **Manage Tables and Fields:**
  - Add **new tables** and **fields** to the model.
  - Organize fields into **folders** for better navigation.
  - Hide fields that you do not want visible in the report view.
  
- **Measure Management:**
  - **Create and manage measures** (such as aggregations, KPIs, calculations) using DAX.
  
- **Relationships View:**
  - **Inspect and modify relationships** between tables in a visual interface.
  - Ensure proper **star schema** design (fact tables connected to dimension tables).

- **Advanced Modeling:**
  - Use **DAX Studio** for more advanced modeling tasks (requires additional tools).
  
- **Data Sources:**
  - **View** and **manage data sources** (e.g., connection strings, query dependencies).

### **4. Power Query Editor (Transform Data)**
While not technically one of the main views (it's an editor), the **Power Query Editor** is essential for data transformation and loading.

#### **Capabilities:**
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Clean, filter, and transform data (e.g., removing duplicates, changing data types, merging queries).
  - **Apply transformations** such as pivoting, unpivoting, and splitting columns.
  - **Group, aggregate**, and manipulate data into desired shapes.
  
- **Query Management:**
  - **Create and manage queries** that transform data before it's loaded into the model.
  - **Merge or append queries** to consolidate multiple tables into one.

- **Advanced Transformation:**
  - Apply **M code** for more advanced transformations and custom logic.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Report View** is where you build and interact with your report, including visualizations and filters.
- **Data View** is where you view and work with the data in its tabular form, manage transformations, and inspect the dataset.
- **Model View** is where you manage the overall data model, including relationships, storage modes, and field organization.
