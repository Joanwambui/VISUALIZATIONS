Custom column Merge
Merging 3 columns with the help of special characters such as hyphen or colon
Will have to add custom column directly

Ribbon click on custom column
Result
=[Product] & ":" [Code] & "-" & [Quantity])

Product and Colour are text but quantity is no therefore we will get an error as the datatypes dontmatch

Result
=[Product] & ":" [Code] & "-" & Number.ToText[Quantity]) 
finally change result column to text
