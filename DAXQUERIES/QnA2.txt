Q/A
Total = a*b/c*d - how to optimize this dax?

Total=
var a =10
var b = 20
var c = 30
var d = 40
var e = a*b
var f = c*d
var g = DIVIDE(e,f)
RETURN g



Difference between star schema and snowflake schema? Each dimension in star schema is represented by one dimension table, contains set of attributes. Fact table is represented at the centre
Fact table contains >80% of the data then star schema
Snowflake schema, Dimension tables are normalized- splitting dimension tables to multiple dimension tables to have less redundant data. Schema should be used when dimension tables huge in size.


What is data flow?
Created in BI Service, live queries that run in BI Service. We reuse the query

Diff refreshes:Manual refresh, scheduled refresh(gateways required), incremental refresh(few predefined steps-create two parameters etc)

Field Parameters? Recently introduced, Helpful to dynamically change axis of the visual

Edit Interactions and block visual to not be affected by slicer

Static RLS
Dynamic RLS

I have a category column with a,b,c,d I wanted to show visual with x axis c,d,a,b. How to handle this scenario:
Tableview and create a new column IF Statement
Test = IF(categorytable[Total Sales]=300,1,IF(categorytable[Total Sales]=400,2,IF(categorytable[Total Sales]=100,3,IF(categorytable[Total Sales]=200,4)

Now click on Category and sort by test column we created above
On the report page now, click on the three elipses and sort axis by category
